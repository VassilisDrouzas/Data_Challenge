# Data_Challenge


The goal of this project is to study and apply machine learning/data mining techniques to a real-world
classification problem. In this classification problem, each sample corresponds to a domain name and
the task is to assign each domain name into a predefined category (i.e., class).

In the context of this project, we are given both a web graph consisting of several thousands of greek
domain names, and the textual content of the webpages of a subset of these domain names. The task
is to build a model for predicting the class label of each domain name. Our
goal is to learn the parameters of a classifier from a collection of training products (with known class
information) and then to predict the class of unlabeled products.
The challenge is hosted on Kaggle, a platform for predictive modelling on which companies, organizations and researchers post their data, and statisticians and data miners from all over the world
compete to produce the best models.
