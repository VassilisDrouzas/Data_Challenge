# Data_Challenge


The goal of this project is to study and apply machine learning/data mining techniques to a real-world
classification problem. In this classification problem, each sample corresponds to a domain name and
the task is to assign each domain name into a predefined category (i.e., class). Such techniques find
applications in several fields, such as in managing web hierarchies, and in question answering systems.
In the context of this project, you are given both a web graph consisting of several thousands of greek
domain names, and the textual content of the webpages of a subset of these domain names. Your task
is to build a model for predicting the class label of each domain name. The problem is very related
to the well-studied problems of text categorization and node classification. The pipeline that is typically followed to deal with the problem is similar to the one applied in any classification problem; the
goal is to learn the parameters of a classifier from a collection of training products (with known class
information) and then to predict the class of unlabeled products.
The challenge is hosted on Kaggle, a platform for predictive modelling on which companies, organizations and researchers post their data, and statisticians and data miners from all over the world
compete to produce the best models
